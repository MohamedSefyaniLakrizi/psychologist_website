# Enhanced Calendar with Availability Integration

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Overview

The calendar system has been enhanced to display availability information across all views (month, week, day), providing a unified experience where availability settings are visually integrated with the appointment calendar.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. **Availability Data Integration**

- **Calendar Component** (`calendar.tsx`): Now fetches both weekly and date availability data
- **Calendar Context** (`calendar-context.tsx`): Enhanced with availability data and helper functions
- **Availability Logic**: Prioritizes date-specific overrides over weekly templates

#### 2. **Month View Enhancements**

- **Empty Days**: Show available time slots with clock icons when no appointments exist
- **Days with Events**: Display availability slots as green badges below events
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear labeling with "Disponible:" prefix
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile and desktop layouts

#### 3. **Week View Enhancements**

- **Background Colors**: Available time slots show subtle green background
- **30-minute Intervals**: Both :00 and :30 minute slots are highlighted
- **Hover Effects**: Enhanced hover states for available slots
- **Multi-day Support**: Works across all 7 days of the week

#### 4. **Day View Enhancements**

- **Availability Backgrounds**: Same green highlighting as week view
- **Time Grid Integration**: Availability visible in both hour halves
- **Sidebar Calendar**: Maintains existing functionality while showing availability

### Technical Details

#### **Data Flow**

```
WeeklyAvailability (recurring template)
       ↓
getAvailabilityForDate() checks DateAvailability overrides
       ↓
Falls back to weekly template if no override exists
       ↓
Returns available time slots for display
```

#### **Availability Logic**

- **Weekly Template**: Monday=0, Tuesday=1, ..., Sunday=6
- **Date Overrides**: Specific dates can have custom hours or be closed
- **Priority**: Date overrides always take precedence over weekly template
- **Closed Days**: null times in DateAvailability = completely closed

#### **Visual Design**

- **Available Slots**: Subtle green background (`bg-green-50/30`)
- **Available Badges**: Green background with border in month view
- **Hover States**: Enhanced green on hover
- **Responsive**: Adapts to mobile/desktop contexts

### Components Modified

1. `app/components/calendar/calendar.tsx` - Data fetching
2. `app/components/calendar/contexts/calendar-context.tsx` - State management
3. `app/components/calendar/views/month-view/day-cell.tsx` - Month view display
